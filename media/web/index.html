			<font size="8" color="#cd4040"><b>YIANG is a</b></font><font size="8"> self-contained <b>Jump'n'Run</b> game featuring an unique ASCII look. It offers <b>32 levels</b> with dozens </font>
			
			<br /><br /><br /> of different enemies, small <b>brainteasers</b> and  <b>hidden scoring possibilities</b>. The game is played for high score and gets faster and faster the longer you survive. <br/> <br />


		<b>It's fun</b>. All you need is your keyboard. See the floating screenshots for a few impressions, or take a look at this page's background which shows some of the game's easier levels (don't want to scare you off).

		<font size="8"><a href="http://www.greentoken.de/releases/yiang/yiang-1.1.zip"> Download YIANG </a> </font> (Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7) - <i>9.8 MiB, full source code included</i>. <br />
<br />
		No installation needed. Simply download the archive, extract it somewhere on your hard disk and run one of the <tt>run_...</tt> files in the main folder (i.e. run <tt>run_fullscreen.bat</tt> to put the game in fullscreen mode).
		</p>

		<p>
		<h2>Linux/Mac</h2>
		Of course, YIANG works on Linux as well. It's a bit more complicated to run, however, and not suitable for minors and cowards. Please download the full game from the download link above and follow the instructions in the <tt>INSTALL</tt> file.
		<br /> <br />
		Mac users basically need the same procedure, but slight changes might be necessary ... ;-)
		</p>

		<h2>Awards</h2>
		YIANG was originally written for the 1. ZFX-Action game programming contest initiated by the german <a href="http://www.zfx.info">zfx</a> board and was ranked first.<br/><br/>
