HAHA! I fooled you. You got killed, lost 10% of your score and you respawned here. As you can see, from time to time it will be necessary to actually commit suicide (well, kind of) in order to advance. So be careful with your lives, for you haven't got too many of them.

The nice guy next to you is your first enemy. You can't kill them, so don't even bother trying it.
