Congratulations. How many tries did you need?

To provide some theoretical background: as almost everything on this planet, teleporters have a color and a teleporter entrance will always teleport you to the closest receiver of the same color. Note that, according to quantum mechanics, there is a slight possibility of you failing to re-appear at the intended location but I seriously wouldn't worry about this.
