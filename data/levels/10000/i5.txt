To get over this small gap, hit {interact} to use this switch. It can control a small bridge, but only if it has the same colour. Colours are essential in this game, you saw two examples but you will see more!

If you want to jump over the gap without the bridge go and try it. Do not worry if you fail you will be teleported up here again.
