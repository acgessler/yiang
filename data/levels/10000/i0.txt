Hello and welcome to THE tutorial! You are probably used to these nifty tutorials at the beginning of your video game and may tend to get annoyed as soon as the word 'tutorial' shows up. Be aware, however, that this tutorial is a bit special. If you play through it (which will take not more than 10 minutes), you might get a special item, so it might be worth the efforts.

If you're still with me, use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move and the UP arrow key to jump. Try to reach the next tutorial block (it is invisible and you might experience severe difficulties finding it). If this setup doesn't suit your typical workflow (or if the corresponding keys are missing on your keyboard) edit ./config/key_bindings.txt. 

See you later (Oh, press {enter} or {accept} to continue!).
