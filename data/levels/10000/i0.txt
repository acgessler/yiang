Hello and welcome to THE tutorial! You are probably used to these boring video game opening tutorials and may tend to get annoyed as soon as the word 'tutorial' shows up. Be aware, however, that this tutorial is a bit special. If you play through me, you will get a special item which might be worth the effort.

If you're still with me, use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move and the UP arrow key to jump. Try to reach the next tutorial block (it is invisible and I hope you won't experience severe difficulties at finding it). If this keyboard setup doesn't suit your preferred key pattern, edit ./config/key_bindings.txt. 

See you later. Hit {enter} or {accept} to continue!
