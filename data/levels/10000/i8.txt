Again a matter of colour in this game:
Now you are painted white; if you fall into these DANGER barrels you will die. That's the normal procedure with these barrels - right i said normal; like every rule has its exception this one too:

if you are coloured in the same colour as the DANGER tiles you can -magically- walk ontop of them wihtout getting hurt!
Test it - now!
