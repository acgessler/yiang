A nasty voice in your mind explains the rules of this world: ASCII life may be a very limited form of life, but it is still worth living and you shouldn't take it without good reason. To aid you at protecting those small creatures, a special rule has been added to this world: you cannot kill other creatures unless they have the same color as you. There are magic bricks to change color, however. Use them with care.


(the voice is getting louder and louder so you turn on your mp3 player and listen to some metal - honestly, real men NEVER read the manual)
