=====================================================================================
II. Linux
=====================================================================================


APPLIES TO
----------

Any (more or less).



WHAT TO DO
----------

This is a bit tricky. The main difference is that we don't embedd PySFML on Linux, so 
the system-wide package is to be taken. The following instructions have been tested 
on Ubuntu 10.04 and may need minor changes to suit your distribution.


SHORT STORY
-----------

The following is the full command sequence (assuming `pwd` is the folder where this file 
resides), below is a detailed explanation to assist you if something goes wrong (if 
anyone wants to hack together a fool-proof shell script or even a MAKE-environment, 
go ahead :-):


	sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev
	sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev 
	wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sfml/SFML-1.5-python-sdk.zip
	unzip SFML-1.5-python-sdk.zip
	cd SFML-1.0/python
	sudo python3 setup.py install
	cd src-cpp
	g++ Main.cpp -lpython3.<py-minor> -o./../bin-<your-arch>-linux/yiang2.0
	g++ MainEditor.cpp -lpython3.<py-minor> -o./../bin-<your-arch>-linux/yiangedit2.0

(substitute appropriate values for <py-minor> and <your-arch>)



FULL NOVEL
-----------

1.) Make sure python3.x is installed. You need the developer files as well.

	$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev

2.) Install SFML 1.5 (1.6 may work as well, but currently no packages are available)
    and the corresponding developer files (you can get them either from their sf.net
    download page or from your package manager).

	$ sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev 
	(+ all the libsfml-.... packages if necessary)

3.) Get PySFML 1.5 for Python 3.x. Taking it from the sf.net page is at the time of 
    this writing (2010-07-22) the only way to do it.

	$ wget, unzip, ... etc.
        (http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sfml/SFML-1.5-python-sdk.zip)

4.) Install PySFML - this can be done using distutils / setup.py in the PySFML folder.
    You may, however, need to edit the setup.py file and add '/usr/include/python3.1' 
    (or wherever your python 3 headers are located!) to the list of include 
    directories (syntactically, it's a python list, so it needs to look like this:
         ['entry','entry2',...] 
    or setup is doomed to fail).

	$ sudo python3 setup.py install

5.) Verify everything is working fine by firing up a python 3 shell (`python3`) and
    try to import the PySFML.sf module. If 'PySFML.sf.Version' is '1.5' or higher, 
    everything is fine.

6.) If there isn't a prebuilt and up-to-date YIANG binary in 
    ./bin-<yourArchitecture>-linux, build it. There's no makefile because building 
    is really straightforward:

  	$ cd src-cpp
	$ g++ Main.cpp -lpython3.<py-minor> -o./../bin-<your-arch>-linux/yiang2.0
	$ g++ MainEditor.cpp -lpython3.<py-minor> -o./../bin-<your-arch>-linux/yiangedit2.0

7.) Run the created executable.
 
	$ cd ../bin-<your-architecture>-linux
	$ ./yiang2.0
